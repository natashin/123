# hello-world

My name is Andrey
I am the father of two cool boys
And I also love the woman who gave birth to the youngest of them, but it's not that simple. She constantly runs away from me and that's why I'm ready for any job to get her back, my son and return to them myself, in general, just to be with my family. It's a long way, but I'm still alive. I stumble and get depressed, but I'm still alive. In general, as long as we are alive, anything is possible. And remember that family is the most important thing in life.

Take care of your loved ones and yourself.
Peace.
